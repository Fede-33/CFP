# You will start your project by creating the code to determine if a piece of space debris is of a dangerous size. For this exercise we will use an arbitrary size of 5

object_size = float (input ("Input object size: "))

if (object_size > 5) :
    print ('Dangerous object')
else :
    print ('Object poses no threat')
